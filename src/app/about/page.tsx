            <p>Hi! I'm Mudasir Sohail Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate FrontEnd web developer with a keen eye for design and functionality. I am pursuing an IT course of Generative AI, Web3 and Metaverse at Governor House Sindh. Where we are currently learning advanced technologies like Next JS. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/Javascript, I enjoy creating beautiful, user-friendly websites. Over the past few months, I've worked on diverse projects, from building simple Calculator to static Student Management System. I specialize in responsive design, ensuring that every user has the best experience, no matter what device they're using.</p>
